## Report

My report is broken up into subfolders for each task, ex: `./task_1` contains instructions, code, screenshots, and any findings/results associated with Task 1. Each subfolder will contains a `README.md` with final results and findings for that task. This document will contain any global findings and useful setup information.

## Submission

My final report is in a single PDF `./REPORT.pdf` which was generated from `./REPORT.md`. `REPORT.md` was built using a simple bash script to compile all the reports in each task subfolder.

## Git

This folder lives in a private Github repository which was then cloned onto each VM. This allowed me to share common setup scripts between the machines. It also allowed me to develop in a single, familiar environment ([Atom.io](https://atom.io) on Mac OS X), and then simply pull down changes in each VM.
